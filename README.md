# Solstash

First assignment for the Solana Summer Fellowship 2024.

A simple CLI wallet designed to interact with the Solana blockchain.

This project requires [bun](https://bun.sh) to work.

To install dependencies and build the project run the following command at the root of the project:

```bash
bun i && bun make
```

To install the cli run the following command at the root of the project:

```bash
npm i -g
```

Solstash should now be installed, to use the cli and list all of the commands run:

```bash
